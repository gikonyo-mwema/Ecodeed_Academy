# ===========================================
# Vite/React Frontend Development Dockerfile
# ===========================================

# Use Node.js LTS version
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for better caching
# package.json contains all dependencies (like requirements.txt for Python)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies from package.json
# This reads package.json and installs all listed dependencies
# Dependencies are cached in this layer - only re-runs if package.json changes
RUN npm install

# Note: node_modules is excluded via .dockerignore for faster builds
# The volume mount in docker-compose.yml may override this
# Consider using a named volume for node_modules in production

# Expose Vite's default port
EXPOSE 5173

# Start the Vite development server
# --host flag allows access from outside the container
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
